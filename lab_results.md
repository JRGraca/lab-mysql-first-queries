LINE RUSH !
Able Black

Note: These apps had a rating of 5. There are 480 other apps with a rating of 5.

7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.

The top 10 apps with the most reviews are pretty much in line with what you'd expect - apps with the highest number of users also tend to have the highest number of reviews. All of these apps are instantly identifiable.
It is curious to note, however, that even though games are by far the category with the most apps (more than 50 % of all apps), they are slightly under-represented in the top 10, with only 4 out of 10 being games.

8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.

Judging by the names, and taking into account that this is only a single analyst's opinion (I probably should have asked someone, but still), most of these apps have very little name recognition (with the exception of Grumpy Cat's Worst Game Ever and Fitness Sync for Fitbit to Apple Health). Judging by the titles, these seem to be largely low-quality, little downloaded apps.
As I note in the answer, there are 490 titles with a rating of 5. Of these, 214 have 100 or less reviews. If you filter the 'rating 5's which have the most reviews, you'll get this list:

Head Soccer
Plants vs. Zombies
Sniper 3D Assassin: Shoot to Kill Gun Game
Geometry Dash Lite
Infinity Blade
Geometry Dash
Domino's Pizza USA
CSR Racing 2
Pictoword: Fun 2 Pics Guess What's the Word Trivia
Plants vs. Zombies HD

Which looks much more close to what we imagine would be the best apps out there... or at least the best games, which is the genre for 9 out of these 10 titles (exception is Domino's Pizza USA)

9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?

Games are not necessarily the most used apps, but they are certainly a good share of the better rated

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?

I'd suggest a formula to calculate a rating score, which would help us weed out apps with very low count of user rankings. The inital score I'd suggest would be total ratings * rating, although given that the Top 3 looks like this:

track_name 		user_rating	rating_count_tot	rating_score
Facebook		3.5			2974676				10411366
Instagram		4.5			2161558				9727011
Clash of Clans	4.5			2130805				9588622.5

I'm of the opinion that the formula needs work, as it doesn't feel right that the top spot is by an app with a 3.5 rating.

11. Do people care about the price?

Note: since we don't have total downloads, I'm using number of reviews as a proxy for number of downloads

To answer that question, we need to take a look at what happens when customers are faced with a price tag. So, first of all, we find out that 43.31% of all apps on the database are paid. However, if we look at the top 100 apps by number of reviews, only 11 (11%, of course) of them are paid. Our first conclusion would be that customers are overwhelmingly more likely to download a free app than a paid app.

If we drill deeper and look only at the paid apps, *none* of the 100 most expensive apps appears in the top 100 by reviews.
When we look at a different set of paid apps, namely the 100 with most reviews, we find something interesting: the average price of this subset is $2,68, which is considerably more than the minimum price of $0,99. Actually 58 of these apps have a price higher that the minimum, and the highest price is $9,99.

To answer the first question: it makes a great difference if a price is paid or not, as a free app takes virtually no commitment from the part of the customer, so free apps have a higher chance of success. However, once an user decides to pay for the app, they don't necessarily pay for the cheaper apps, ie, there is not a lot of price sensitivity.
Further analysis should focus on the type of apps to find out if some genres are more successful than others and if ratings make a difference (although a strong prior that apps with better reviews have more downloads is not unreasonable).
